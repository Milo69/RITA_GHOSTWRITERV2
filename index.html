            I live it up like these are my last days<br>
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid<br>
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass<br>
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag<br>
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting<br>
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect<br>
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all hater<br>
But I put up a wall, and they just together<br>
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like paper<br>
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather<br>
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free<br>
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me<br>
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feather<br>
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather<br>
I stick to the script, I memorize the line<br>
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many time<br>
You're on the outside looking in, close the blind<br>
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind<br>
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong<br>
Hello Weezy, welcome home<br>
