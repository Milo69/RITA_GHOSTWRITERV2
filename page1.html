          I'm pourin' fours and shit, I need to just put a deuce in<br>
Car cost four-hundred-thou' and I put a roof in<br>
My nigga pot cook it so good he put his shoe in it<br>
Nigga, it's a gangsta party, why fuck is you in it<br>
Head bust a microwave, shit, didn't take him two minutes<br>
You know that there's some straps in the club, they let my crew in<br>
I might just do the Michael Vick man and cook it left hand<br>
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man<br>
I can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon<br>
I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rode man<br>
